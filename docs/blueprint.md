# **App Name**: ABalytics

## Core Features:

- Data Input: Users can input metric, mean, variance, real estate, number of users, minimum detectable effect (MDE), statistical power and significance level (alpha).
- Sample Size Calculation: Powered by a statistical reasoning tool, calculate the required sample size per variant based on inputted values. If provided variance is too high/low or the user base is insufficient, provide appropriate warnings. Factor real estate (e.g., Home Page, PDP), statistical power, and significance level into sample size estimation.
- Result Display: Present results in a table showing Total sample size required (per group), Estimated duration (based on daily users), and a clear recommendation on whether current traffic is sufficient.
- Report Download: Enable export and download sample size report to share with relevant stake holders.
- MDE Explorer: Input (or select) an experiment duration in weeks and display the MDE detectable with the available sample size, enabling informed trade-offs between test duration and MDE sensitivity.
- Trade-off Visualization: The system estimates the sample size available for each duration based on historical daily user counts. Present trade-offs visually with charts and tables showing the relation of total users, achievable MDE, and test duration.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) for a sophisticated and data-driven feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that keeps the focus on the data.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight key metrics and call to actions (CTAs).
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a modern and neutral look suitable for data-heavy applications.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif to give a techy, scientific feel.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons to represent different metrics and data parameters.  Use subtle color cues to associate icons with the primary color.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure precise alignment and consistent spacing. Prioritize information hierarchy and accessibility.
- Subtle animations for transitions between data views or during calculations. Feedback animations when toggling MDE / test duration values.
